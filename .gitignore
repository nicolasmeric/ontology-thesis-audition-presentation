# ∙ fragile=singleslide tells beamer that the frame contents is "fragile."
# This means that the frame contains text that is not "interpreted as usual."
# For example, this applies to verbatim text,
# which is, obviously, interpreted somewhat differently from normal text.
# If a frame contains fragile text,
# different internal mechanisms are used to typeset the frame
# to ensure that inside the frame the character codes can be reset.
# The price of switching to another internal mechanism is
# that either you cannot use overlays or
# an external file needs to be written and read back
# (which is not always desirable).
# In detail,
# the following happens when this option is given for normal (pdf)LATEX:
# The contents of the frame is scanned and then written to
# a special file named ⟨jobname⟩.vrb or,
# if a label has been assigned to the frame,
# ⟨jobname⟩.⟨current frame number⟩.vrb.
# Then, the frame is started anew and
# the content of this file is read back.
# Since, upon reading of a file, the character codes can be modified,
# this allows you to use both verbatim text and overlays.
# To determine the end of the frame, the following rule is used:
# The first occurrence of a single line containing
# exactly \end{⟨frame environment name⟩} ends the frame.
# The ⟨environment name⟩ is normally frame,
# but it can be changed using the environment option.
# This special rule is needed since the frame contents is,
# after all, not interpreted when it is gathered.
# You can also add the optional information =singleslide.
# This tells beamer that the frame contains only a single slide.
# In this case, the frame contents is not written to a special file,
# but interpreted directly, which is "faster and cleaner."
# See beamer documentation file beameruserguide.pdf,
# version 3.55, section 8.1, page 61.
